## TRAVEL NEPAL
The title of the project is Travel Nepal. The project is about posting the travel blogs of the user and other user can comment on the post of the blogs.
there are many information gathering process regarding the different places of Nepal that helps the travelers to 
visit those places. People find their travel destinations from different sources like books, website, recommendations 
etc. but the information that are present there only highlight the famous places of the country like the cultural heritages,
cities etc. But the application aims to provide information about the hidden treasures of the country the places where there
are less tourist attraction and the places where the real beauty of the country can be found be it the landscape, people or
nature. The application also tries to advertise infamous places of Nepal that should be made known to the rest of the world.
Finally the main focus of my application is to promote the tourism.

## RestClient
As a RestCline, Retrofit2 is being used beacause of its feature. i.e  It makes it relatively easy to retrieve and upload JSON
(or other structured data) via a REST based webservice. In Retrofit you configure which converter is used for the data 
serialization. Typically for JSON you use GSon, but you can add custom converters to process XML or other protocols.
Retrofit uses the OkHttp library for HTTP requests.

To work with Retrofit you basically need the following three classes:
    • Model class which is used as a JSON model
    • Interfaces that define the possible HTTP operations
    • Retrofit.Builder class - Instance which uses the interface and the Builder API to allow defining the URL end 
    point for the HTTP operations.
